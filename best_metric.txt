I've chosen Root Mean Squared Error as the performance metric because it directly reflects the average error in the same units as the target variable, which makes it very practical to interpret. I appreciate how RMSE penalizes larger errors more heavily, and this aligns with my goal of minimizing significant discrepancies in predictions. RMSE's sensitivity to outliers is key and it could be seen as a benefit since it emphasizes the reduction of large errors. This characteristic however would have me consider to revisit my data if it were heavily skewed or included many outliers. Additionally, RMSE is well-suited for the optimization process in many machine learning models, making it a fitting choice for regression.
